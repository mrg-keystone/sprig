# Contract: ui-breakdown

> **Producer:** breakdown · **Consumer:** build · Pipeline: design → prototype → breakdown → build → audit

A **`spec/ui/breakdown/`** directory detailed enough that `build` can rebuild each page and
component **mechanically, without opening the source.** This is the **translation boundary**:
whatever the source used (daisyUI, inline styles, bespoke CSS), what crosses into `build` here is
framework-neutral **tokens + specs**.

## Artifact — directory shape
```
spec/ui/breakdown/
├── index.md              # page inventory, usage matrix, build order, interaction tiers, Unassigned list
├── design-tokens.md      # palette, type, spacing, radii, shadows, easing → Tailwind 4 @theme
├── data-model.md         # the implied backend schema (entities, enums, relationships, cardinality)
├── assets/               # images/fonts/svgs lifted from source
├── shared-components/<name>/   # used on >1 page
│   ├── <name>.md         # the component spec (see "Each component spec carries")
│   ├── isolate/          # real fixture.json + cases/<state>/<state>.json

└── pages/<page>/
    ├── <page>.md, isolate/, screenshots/   # pages isolate too: real fixture.json + cases/
    └── components/<name>/   # page-local components (same shape)
```

## Shape (what `build` can rely on)
- **Tokens are Tailwind v4 `@theme` custom properties** — NOT a `tailwind.config.js`, NOT daisyUI.
  Build puts them in a `:global(...)` `@theme` block (usually `shell/styles.css`) and styles with
  **Tailwind utilities** + component-scoped `styles.css` (the daisyUI→Tailwind translation already
  happened *here*); `sprig build` runs Tailwind v4 over the templates + CSS. Every theme variant included.
- **Each component spec carries:** classification (`static` | `island` | `page-composition`) +
  the interaction tier (static / island; server writes are **optimistic UI**, realtime where
  needed); anatomy; a props table (1:1 with `fixture.json` controls, `signal: true` for island
  state); states→cases; **Events** as `capture(page)` predicate sketches; **Motion extracted**
  (real keyframes/easing + jank fixes — reproduce, don't reinvent); responsive; a11y; and an
  **Isolate build plan** — the build-in-isolation recipe (folder + selector, the preview route(s),
  per case the screenshot to diff against, the Events→`tests/` mapping, and the `sprig isolate` →
  diff → test → iterate loop) so the build session can stand the thing up alone from the spec.
- **`isolate/` proposals are real and runnable** (`fixture.json` + `cases/<state>/<state>.json`),
  discoverable by `sprig isolate`, for **every component AND every page** (pages isolate too); a
  component is a **folder** (`template.html` + optional `logic.ts`), its **basename the selector**
  — no `.tsx`. Case JSON carries the **real captured values** the screenshot shows.
- **`index.md` carries the build order** (tokens → shared components → page-local → page
  compositions), the interaction-tier summary, and an **Unassigned list that ships even empty**.

## Invariants
- **Location:** `spec/ui/breakdown/` (sibling to `spec/ui/design-system/` and `spec/ui/<app>-prototype.html`).
- A reader could rebuild from the spec alone, without the source.
- Schema only in `data-model.md` / prose; real data rows live **only** in case JSON.
- The full `fixture.json` / `capture(page)` format is the `breakdown` skill's own
  `references/isolate-format.md`.

## Validation
`sprig isolate` discovers every proposal; each component **and page** diffs clean vs its
`screenshots/` and its `isolate/` cases are green before anything builds on it; every component/page
carries an **Isolate build plan** the builder can follow without the source; `index.md` Unassigned
is empty.
